## User Story

**As a** burnt out student,  
**I want** to track my tasks my tasks,  
**So that** I can stay more organized or get even more burnt out ü¶≠

## Narrative

### Use/Purpose

Simple Task Manager (formerly Task Manager) has went through many revisions because I change my mind a lot. 
This task manager is a web application designed to help users organize their tasks which are ranked by priority.

### Development Story

This has been an overhauled project that's had many iterations. Main inspiration is from several YouTube videos on making
a Task Manager web application.

## Future App Ideas

1. **User Accounts**: Add real authentication
2. **Search Functionality**: Add ability to search through tasks
3. **Due Date Reminders**: Implement notifications for upcoming due dates
